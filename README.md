# Registration Form

This project contains a simple registration form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form collects basic user information, validates the input fields, and can be integrated into any website or web application.

## Features

- **User Information Fields**: Includes fields for name, email, password, and confirmation.
- **Form Validation**: Ensures all fields are filled out and checks for valid email format and password match.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Easy Customization**: Add or remove fields as needed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/registration-form.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd registration-form
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view and test the form.

## Usage

- Modify the HTML file (`index.html`) to add more input fields or customize the form layout.
- Customize the form's look by editing the styles in `styles.css`.
- Client-side validation is handled in `script.js`. You can modify it to add custom validation rules.

## Fields Included

- **Name**: Full name of the user.
- **Email**: Valid email address.
- **Password**: Strong password (with a confirmation field).
- **Submit Button**: To send the form data for further processing (connect it to your backend if needed).

## Validation Rules

- **Email**: Must be a valid email address (example: user@example.com).
- **Password**: Must meet certain criteria (e.g., minimum length, match confirmation).

## Customization

- Add more fields by updating the `form` element in the `index.html`.
- Modify the form validation logic in `script.js` to include custom rules (e.g., password strength).
- Style the form to match your website's theme by adjusting the `styles.css`.
